# Minecraft clone spitball

# each block is a chunk and chunk is a block
# like antman and minecraft had a baby
# all about switching scales

# certain mob encounters can deny switching scales, mainly by wizards
# who can also navigate through scale
# but also by quantum creatures, who if any are observing you, your
# equipment won't operate correctly

# simpler mobs will be controlled by simple neural networks
# these mobs will also be structures, or, like, dynamic rooms the player can
# enter. Think of shrinking down and going inside of a pig. The world outside is no
# longer rendered. You're practically in another dimension, which is just a small set of
# rooms where you can mess with the pig's stomach and brain.
# You mess with the brain by literally altering the neural net, which is represented by
# blocks within the brain, on level Q-1
# when you leave or when the animal dies, your position is updated by where you exit on the
# animal and where it was.

# level Q is the quantum level
# level 0 is the god level
# denoted either layer L or layer Q-N where N is 1..L
# for now, layer 3 is the classic MC layer


# Quantum level blocks have special flags denoting they don't contain chunk info
# either that or they are simply integers within the arrays of Q-1
# Players with access to the quantum level also have the ability to wormhole anywhere
# in the world (that has been explored)

## Infinitium Bird Feather Staff
# Allows users to glide down from the top of the chunk when switching scales
# position and velocity into realm upon change will be dependent of the position and velocity
# of the staff in the larger dimension. So you can sling yourself into existence.


## Infinitium Rings
# Rare rings held by wizards. Can power tools or be melted down into Infinitium for more advanced crafting.

### Textured Blocks (layer Q-1 : real blocks)
## Infinitium (Endgame)
# Extremely rare element that, when arranged a certain way, taps in to a latent form of energy that flows
# freely throughout the fabric of the universe.
# Seemingly limitless, this energy can be delivered in mass quantities any instant, or be safely ignored and
# self-containing. This makes it great for powering handleld devices and machinery, altering gravity, synthesizing matter, etc.
# Some scientists worry that the harvesting of extreme amounts of energy too quickly could have universe-threatening
# consequences.
# Texture Details:
# -White-gold metallic appearance
# Variants: {dormant, infused}

## Uranium (Mid-endgame)
# Rare element that provides incredibly large amounts of energy, but depletes itself doing so.
#

## Elytra
# Item similar to elytra will allow for gliding. The catch however is that elytra will not work
# in the macro layers. It will also not be very good in the classic layer. However speed and control
# will greatly compound throughout the lower layers, allowing smaller players to fly around like bugs
# around larger players.

## Attacking and tool usage
# Attacking and tool usage in this game will be probably the only physics-based parts of this game.
# Swings on tools, swords, and staffs will use data of the position and velocity of the tool to calculate
# power, damage, what have you. To larger players, it will seem like their tools swing slow, and to
# smaller players, their tools will swing fast.

## Scales (1 block = ? tall&wide)
## https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cells/scale/
# 0:God        - 1536 ft (Empire State Building)
# 1:Colossal   - 192 ft (field goal to 50 yd line)
# 2:Giant      - 24 ft
# 3:Normal     - 3 ft (Roughly 1 meter, inbetween a skateboard and guitar)
# 4:Small      - 4.5 in (block is a little smaller than a Gamecube)
# 5:Mini       - 0.5 in (12mm) (Average width of middle finger nail)
# 6:Teeny      - 1.8 mm (Tip of crayon, or a small ant)
# 7:Tiny       - 0.2 mm (Tardigrade)
# 8:Micro      - 25 micrometers (skin cell)
# 9:Supermicro - 3.1 micrometers (yeast cell. X Chromosome would be 2 blocks tall)

# 10:Microbial
# 10a:Nano      - 390 nm (2 bacteriophages stacked)
# 10b:Supernano - 49 nm (hepatitis)
# 10c:Meganano  - 6.1 nm (hemoglobin or tRNA) (Proteasome lives here, a barrel that destroys proteins)

# 11:Pico      - 760 pm (amino acid, glucose) (molecular level) (dodging molecules and radiation is the game here)
# 12:Atomic    - 95 pm (water molecule or carbon atom would take up a 3x3x3 space, which is perfect to represent in blocks)
                 on the atomic level, every chunk is a molecule or molecules, which represent a material
                 such as water, a solution of water and salt, an alloy, etc.
# 13:Quantum   - Size does not exist at this scale. Nothing really does, its just a buffer layer, but you can
                 set up quantum tunnels here to create traversible wormholes for anyone in the atomic realm and
                 do some other weird stuff I guess.

### Mobs
### Each mob either has free will or an alterable behaviour circuit.
### Circuits can be altered to control their minds.
### Most mobs are specific to one or two layers, but a few mobs can traverse them like you can (i.e. Wizards)
### All mobs are defined by the layer above which they are composed and whose meshes their physics interact with.
## Player (any layer) (home layer 3) (1x2x1)
# Player controlled by a human. Can change their size and operate on different scales. 
## Wizards (any layer) (commonly found on layer 3) (free will) (1x2x1)
# Dressed in off-white and gold, casting archaic, strange spells. Emphasis on "strange"...
# They start out friendly and helpful, but become hostile once a user acquires <blank>... (maybe Uranium)
## The Eternal (layer 0) (N/A) : After you kill Colossus and an angel, The Eternal takes you on himself.
## Colossus (layer 1) (1x2x1) : When a giant views Collosus, they know what it's like to be a human.
## Whale (layer 2) (3x1x1) : also giant squid, normal giants (titans), and other cool stuff
## Player (layer 3) (1x2x1)
## Small Bird (layer 4) (1x1x1) : little mice are like big dogs
## Dragonfly (layer 5) (2x0.5x1) to (4x1x2) : also spiders can be big and scary here
## Ant (layer 6) (2x1x1) to (4x2x2)
## Tardigrade (layer 7) (1x1x1) : in its home level, the tardigrade has a camoflage ability. fairyflies found here too (egg-eating parasite)
##                                a block here is the size of a eukaryotic cell 
## White Blood Cell (layer 8) (1x1x1) : slow moving, heavy hitting mob. best dealt with from a distance
## E. coli (layer 9) (1x0.25x0.25) : tries to grab and strangle the player
## Viruses (layer 10a-10c) : all sorts of freaky mobs that do freaky things, also proteasome
## Moving particles (layer 11) : here the only thing you have to worry about is getting collided with by other stuff.
## Wizards (layer 12) : the wizards do not like you messing around on the atomic layer. Here they can be found weilding infinitium tools.
## Angels (layer 12 or any) : Angels are believed to come from a higher dimension of spacetime. They have strange geometry and morph as they move,
                       as if our 3d perception of them was merely a shadow cast onto us from a higher dimension. They are benevolent and remain 
                       hidden until you discover infinitium (on layer 12), after which they become extremely hostile mini-bosses if you overuse 
                       it (and can appear on any layer).
## Quantum Worms (layer Q) :
