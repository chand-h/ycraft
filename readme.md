# Minecraft clone spitball

  each block is a chunk and chunk is a block
  like antman and minecraft had a baby
  all about switching scales

  certain mob encounters can deny switching scales, mainly by wizards
  who can also navigate through scale
  but also by quantum creatures, who if any are observing you, your
  equipment won't operate correctly

  simpler mobs will be controlled by simple neural networks
  these mobs will also be structures, or, like, dynamic rooms the player can
  enter. Think of shrinking down and going inside of a pig. The world outside is no
  longer rendered. You're practically in another dimension, which is just a small set of
  rooms where you can mess with the pig's stomach and brain.
  You mess with the brain by literally altering the neural net, which is represented by
  blocks within the brain, on level Q-1
  when you leave or when the animal dies, your position is updated by where you exit on the
  animal and where it was.

  level Q is the quantum level
  level 0 is the god level
  denoted either layer L or layer Q-N where N is 1..L
  for now, layer 3 is the classic MC layer


  Quantum level blocks have special flags denoting they don't contain chunk info
  either that or they are simply integers within the arrays of Q-1
  Players with access to the quantum level also have the ability to wormhole anywhere
  in the world (that has been explored)

   Infinitium Bird Feather Staff
  Allows users to glide down from the top of the chunk when switching scales
  position and velocity into realm upon change will be dependent of the position and velocity
  of the staff in the larger dimension. So you can sling yourself into existence.


   Infinitium Rings
  Rare rings held by wizards. Can power tools or be melted down into Infinitium for more advanced crafting.

    Textured Blocks (layer Q-1 : real blocks)
   Infinitium (Endgame)
  Extremely rare element that, when arranged a certain way, taps in to a latent form of energy that flows
  freely throughout the fabric of the universe.
  Seemingly limitless, this energy can be delivered in mass quantities any instant, or be safely ignored and
  self-containing. This makes it great for powering handleld devices and machinery, altering gravity, synthesizing matter, etc.
  Some scientists worry that the harvesting of extreme amounts of energy too quickly could have universe-threatening
  consequences.
  Texture Details:
  -White-gold metallic appearance
  Variants: {dormant, infused}

   Uranium (Mid-endgame)
  Rare element that provides incredibly large amounts of energy, but depletes itself doing so.
 

   Elytra
  Item similar to elytra will allow for gliding. The catch however is that elytra will not work
  in the macro layers. It will also not be very good in the classic layer. However speed and control
  will greatly compound throughout the lower layers, allowing smaller players to fly around like bugs
  around larger players.

   Attacking and tool usage
  Attacking and tool usage in this game will be probably the only physics-based parts of this game.
  Swings on tools, swords, and staffs will use data of the position and velocity of the tool to calculate
  power, damage, what have you. To larger players, it will seem like their tools swing slow, and to
  smaller players, their tools will swing fast.

   Scales
  Colossal (eats whales like they're chicken legs)
  Giant (about whale sized)
  Normal
  Small (could ride a bird or a large dragonfly)
  Tiny (ants are dog-sized)

    Mobs
    Each mob either has free will or an alterable behaviour circuit.
    Circuits can be altered to control their minds.
    Most mobs are specific to one or two layers, but a few mobs can traverse them like you can (i.e. Wizards)
   Player (any layer) (home layer 3)
  Player controlled by a human. Can change their size and operate on different scales. 
   Wizards (any layer) (commonly found on layer 3) (free will)
  Dressed in off-white and gold, casting archaic, strange spells. Emphasis on "strange"...
  They start out friendly and helpful, but become hostile once a user acquires <blank>... (maybe Uranium)
   Dragonfly (layer 4)
